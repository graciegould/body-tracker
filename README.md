# Triadic flow
This project creates a responsive and interactive installation using p5.js and tfjs posenet ai body tracking model. The canvas displays triangles that move and reshape based on detected bodies, creating a dynamic visual effect that can respond to human gestures in real-time. This setup is suitable for art installations and interactive displays.
